Module 8 - Elementary sorts
Learning by doing-1
Show, how selection sort sorts the array E A S Y Q U E S T I O N.
A:
Step 1: convert the Alphabets to the Ascii values.
Step 2:Assign the min position to first element
Step 3: Run the loop and sort it out.
            Expected output:

If a = {3, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0} is the input for below code

public class Insertion { 

public static void sort(Comparable[] a) { 	

int N = a.length; 

for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) { 

for (int j = i; j > 0 && less(a[ j ], a[j-1]); j--) 

exch(a, j, j-1); 

} 

}

}

}


Answer the following questions

Note: while writing answers use the following notation [1, 2, 3, 4]

	

Print the elements in the array a, after completion of 2nd iteration of loop i

	Ans:[3,4,6,2,1,0]
	

Print the elements in the array a, in 3rd iteration of i and after completion of 2nd iteration of loop j
	
	Ans:[2,3,4,6,1,0]
 

Print the elements in the array a, in 4th iteration of i and after completion of 1st iteration of loop j
 
	Ans:[1,2,3,4,6,0]


8. Which method runs faster for an array with all keys identical, basic selection sort or basic insertion sort?

	Ans:Time complexity of Selection- O(n2);-best case=worst case.
	        Time Complexity of Insertion sort-O(n)-best case ,O(n2)-worst case.
               			So, the insertion sort is better.
8.Which method runs faster for an array in reverse order, basic selection sort or basic insertion sort?
	Ans:Time complexity of Selection- O(n2);-best case=worst case.
	        Time Complexity of Insertion sort-O(n)-best case ,O(n2)-worst case.
               			So, the both are same.
